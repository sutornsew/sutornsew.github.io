# Modern tech is worse

Back then, I remember traversing around the internet without much problem. The only bottleneck was my internet. Web pages are packed with personality. But right now, it feels soulless and corporate.  

However, I won't be talking about how "The old internet was better and filled with personality!" The main focus is about performance of the devices and technologies.  

I am a zoomer. Grew up in a not so wealthy family but lucky enough to get to use PCs and even own a smartphone. I don't remember the exact appearance of my first PC I got. But it was quite tiny (My best guess that it is a small Thinkcentre or Dell optiplex micro) and it came with Windows 7. You could argue that when I was a kid, I had more patience. But on this current machine of mine (Quite powerful now, runs Street Fighter 6 on High settings) struggles to open LinkedIn web pages on FireFox. Taking almost more than a minute to load whilst making the CPU Fan run like a jet engine.

I had doubts about my beliefs but it was too blatant to ignore. Modern websites are so slow. They force you to download megabytes of Javascript files to even function. Disrupting your experience with too much ads. An average blog now requires me to scroll down for almost a minute, obstructing half of the viewport with ads. And not to mention the infuriating irrelavant globs of texts that no one cares about.  

The mobile side of things is what I'm most curious about. My phone has been operating flawlessly since I've ever had it. Well, it was released in 2021 (Redmi Note 10). So you could argue that it's pretty modern and all of the slow stuff was the fault of the unoptimized apps. My mother's phone on the other hand is **JANK.** It's bonkers how a phone released in 2024 (Galaxy A16) could be this janky. And she did not even do much on the phone. Most of the time she's on the social media, texts and calls family. Some mobile banking and shopping. I download games and bloat my phone with unused app to the point where I had to migrate files to an SD card. This has to be studied.

Performance on mobile phones should be roughly the same in the home launcher and doing basic operations. However, I've seen several phones so stuttery in just the settings page. I couldn't comprehend how this could happen. Does the phone know how tech savvy the user is? Impossible. All everyone does on the phone is just browsing the internet, texting and calling. Back when was using a small phone with Android Jelly Bean, I didn't have any problems. Is it the hardware? The software? Planned obsolescence? If this is intentional, it would be the best and worst thing I've ever know of. How do you even implement it? You keep track of time internally and set the CPU frequency to be lower? But why does my phone operate normally? Heck, I bet other people have older phones that work fine. How many models have these problems? Is it specific to the company? The factory? WHAT IS IT!?!?

I'm **SICK** of modern "tech" and planned obsolescence. It forces you to be on the bleeding edge and buy new products as much as they could force you. This page requires Javascript! Bad performance? Not our problem! Sign in to use our platform of the blog that you need to skim for 10 seconds! Hey! Wanna hear about this news about our company? Unsubscribe from our newsletter? Are you sure?? Oops, you won't get the headphone jack for new phone model anymore! Buy the TWS earbuds or buy this dongle! No, you can't open the back of your phone anymore. It's dangerous! Third party repair shops are not recommended! (The official repair shop just replace bad parts.) To be one with the web dev hoarde you must learn this framework that stinks and require JS! We won't support this OS anymore. You can't upgrade to the new one though, your hardware is not compatible. You don't have internet? You need it! Or else you can't create an account to use this computer! 
This game runs on 4K yes! But you need the most AI upscale of the flagship model though! Oh silly consumer! You need to connect your fridge to the internet! It's for the best "experience" This AI wil- Just stop.

I care more about the e-wastes than the rich draining consumer's money. More tech obsolete means more e-wastes. Repairing just got as worst as it could. Reusing for the non tech-savy is almost impossible now since daily driving will require you a secure OS (That's not Linux). And they will use it to visit modern sites that eats up all of the processing power anyway. Not to mention the AI and data centers too.

And the worst part is, you can't escape this system. To get the news, keep in touch with others, entertain yourself, you **NEED** modern tech. No matter how much you try. Your workplace, institute, society, the industry will have you use it like it's normal. It is. But it's crap. What a world we live in.  

Sorry for the rant. There are some points that could be phrased better or something that's not really related to the topic or wrong arguments but I'll still keep it that way. If you have any experience or want to correct something, you are always welcome to contact me.
